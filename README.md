# shipfiring-bullet
Graphical game using pygame module in python


In ship firing bullet , the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

I have used Pygame, a collection of fun, powerful Python modules that manage graphics, animation, and even sound, making it easier  to build sophisticated games. With Pygame handling tasks like drawing images to the screen, we can focus on the higher-level logic of game dynamics.
